                Aaron, a.k.a. <em>AA-Ron</em>, a.k.a. <em>Keebs</em>, a.k.a. <em>DJ Ziplock</em> is the cat’s pajamas in the kitchen and the fox’s socks on the dance floor. 
                Starting his adventure in the 90’s in Madison, WI you better believe he tried to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg6CiPI6h2g" title="Pokemon Theme Song"><strong>“catch ‘em all”</strong></a> . 
                Stumbling into his first screen print class at the UW-Madison, he immediately fell in love and became a Fine Arts Major. 
                Blending personal moments and playful imagery, his prints become meaningful and approachable. 
                Previously, you’d find him nerding-out around buckets of ink and a multitude of squeegees in the Green Mountains of VT. 
                Now-a-days you’ll find him hidden away in his home office outside of Chicago trying to learn how to become a Software Engineer or listening to smooth jazz and lo-fi hip-hop in the kitchen making a mean meal like a mad-man!
                 Talk print or food to him… <em>he likes it that way.</em>

                Hey, just wanted to say thanks for checking out my weird and wacky webpage! 
                This is my first dive into the front-end side of Software Engineering. 
                You can probably tell that the design of the page is deifnitely <em>*unique*</em>, 
                but this was just a place to test things out, learn about the basics and see what's possible. 
                I'm excited for the road ahead and we'll see what happens next. Until then, cheers!
