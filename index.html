                Aaron, a.k.a. AA-Ron, a.k.a. Keebs, a.k.a. DJ Ziplock is the cat’s pajamas in the kitchen and the fox’s socks on the dance floor. 
                Starting his adventure in the 90’s in Madison, WI you better believe he tried to “catch ‘em all”. 
                Stumbling into his first screen print class at the UW-Madison, he immediately fell in love and became a Fine Arts Major. 
                Blending personal moments and playful imagery, his prints become meaningful and approachable. 
                Previously, you’d find him nerding-out around buckets of ink and a multitude of squeegees in the Green Mountains of VT. 
                Now-a-days you’ll find him hidden away in his home office outside of Chicago trying to learn how to become a Software Engineer or listening to smooth jazz in the kitchen making a mean meal like a mad-man!
                 Talk print or food to him… he likes it that way.
